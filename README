I. Building the meta-am335x-bsp BSP layer
========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website.

To enable the am335xsk-bsp layer, add the am335x-bsp MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "am335xsk-bsp"

You should then be able to build a am335x-bsp image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-xfce

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a USB flash drive (see instructions on how to do
that below, in the section 'Booting the images from /binary').
