I. Building the meta-am335x-bsp BSP layer
========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website.

To enable the am335xsk-bsp layer, add the am335x-bsp MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "am335xsk-bsp"

You should then be able to build a am335x-bsp image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a USB flash drive (see instructions on how to do
that below, in the section 'Booting the images from /binary').

As an alternative to downloading the BSP tarball, you can also work
directly from the meta-xxxx git repository.  For each BSP in the
'meta-xxxx' repository, there are multiple branches, one corresponding
to each major release starting with 'laverne' (0.90), in addition to
the latest code which tracks the current master (note that not all
BSPs are present in every release).  Instead of extracting a BSP
tarball at the top level of your yocto build tree, you can
equivalently check out the appropriate branch from the meta-xxxx
repository at the same location.
